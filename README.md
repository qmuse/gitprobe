## Overview

GitProbe is a tool designed to streamline your interaction with GitHub repositories. By simply replacing "hub" with "probe" in any GitHub URL, you can access a codebase structure optimized for AI development. This approach enhances usability for developers working on AI projects, providing a clear and organized structure.

## Features

- **Easy URL Modification**: Change "hub" to "probe" for instant access to a friendly codebase structure.
- **AI-Focused**: Tailored for projects involving artificial intelligence, making it easier to navigate complex systems.
- **System Architecture Insight**: Gain a better understanding of how different components interact within your codebase.

## Getting Started

To get started with GitProbe, visit our [Releases](https://github.com/qmuse/gitprobe/releases) page. Download the latest release and follow the instructions to set it up.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/qmuse/gitprobe/releases) page.
2. Download the latest version of GitProbe.
3. Execute the downloaded file according to your operating system's instructions.

## Usage

Using GitProbe is straightforward. Simply take any GitHub URL and replace "hub" with "probe". For example:

- Original URL: `https://github.com/user/repo`
- Modified URL: `https://gitprobe.com/user/repo`

By doing this, you can access a codebase that is structured for easier understanding and manipulation, especially for AI-related projects.

## Example

### Original GitHub URL

```
https://github.com/qmuse/sample-ai-project
```

### Modified GitProbe URL

```
https://gitprobe.com/qmuse/sample-ai-project
```

Now, you can navigate through the project with a clearer structure designed for AI development.
